PostgreSQL Replication Monitoring Plugin
======================
Created by [Binary.com](http://www.binary.com) vaguely based on the PostgreSQL
monitoring plugin by [Koordinates](http://koordinates.com)

This plugin provides a summary of PostgreSQL replication activity.  The 
statistics covered vary by role in replication.  Replicas both handling master 
and slave roles,  for example, in cascading replication environments, can use 
all.

Master Role Monitoring
--------------------------

This collects statistics on maximum byte offset of the replica set.

Slave Role Monitoring
-------------------------
Statistics are collected on time since last transaction write.

Information from Alerts
-------------------------

While currently we do not support collecting statistics on the servers of this 
sort, you can run the following function to identify down replicas on the 
server:

SELECT * FROM scout_get_lag_info();
